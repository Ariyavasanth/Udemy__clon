# Udemy Flexbox & Media Queries Project

This repository showcases a project I built while learning web development concepts on Udemy. Through this project, I gained a solid understanding of using **Flexbox** for layout and **Media Queries** for responsive design.

## Features

- **Flexbox Layout**: Utilized Flexbox to create flexible and adaptive web layouts.
- **Responsive Design**: Implemented media queries to ensure the design is responsive across various screen sizes.

## What I Learned

1. How to structure layouts using Flexbox properties like `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-wrap`.
2. How to create responsive designs using media queries.
3. Practical application of CSS to make a project visually appealing and functional.
